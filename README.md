> A typesetting system for those with severe motor disabilities

There is a gap in technology available for teaching and typesetting math for those who are unable to do so traditionally
or by using the standard LaTex systems available. This program seeks to create a system for typesetting mathematics 
using the fewest keys possible in hopes of making typesetting of elementary through high-school mathematics as easily
as possible, specifically for those with severe motor disabilities.
